# Jira_Glass_1.4_Version_Testing

Project Participants (Pivarcsi Ádám, Pádár Balázs)

In this project we used Katalon Studion to test the released version of Atlassian Jira Glass 1.4 addon.
First time to use Groovy for test automation.
We needed to answer a question: Based on our tests do we recommend the release to the public?

Technologies and Frameworks:

Katalon Studio - DDT, POM, Keyword Driven Testing

Common values (username, password,base url, ect) are saved in a profile file, which is not commited for security reasons.
